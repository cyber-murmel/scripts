# scripts
* **`wifi`** is a bash script, that sets up the wifi interface, starts wpa_supplicant with the configfile in `/etc/wpa_supplicant/main.conf` and then starts the dhcpcd.
* **`flipscreen`** is written for my tablet laptop, because I was to lazy to configure the correct behavior the event of turning the screen. It simply tells xrandr and xinput to invert the image and the inputs. It is mappd to a display key through my awesome config.
